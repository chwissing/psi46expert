Build and installation of psi46expert
=====================================

1. Dependencies
---------------
To install psi46expert a few libraries and programs are required:

  - libusb 1.0
  - libftd2xx	(http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm)
  - ROOT	(http://root.cern.ch)
  - libtool, autoconf, automake

If these are installed in special directories (not /usr or /usr/local)
then you have to take measures that the compiler finds your files
(set and export PATH, CPATH, LIBRARY_PATH environment variables).

2. Preparing the sources after SVN (subversion) checkout
--------------------------------------------------------
After checking out the sources from SVN, run the following command
in the working directory:

	./autogen

3. Compiling the sources
------------------------
Run

	./configure [--prefix=SOMEDIR]
	make

with the option [--prefix=SOMEDIR] optional, then

5. Installing the software
--------------------------
The software is installed by typing

	make install

4. Running the software
-----------------------
You will need a configuration directory for Modules/ROCs:

	cp -r data/defaultParameters<X> WHEREVER

Then you can run

	psi46expert -dir WHEREVER

5. Frequent problems
--------------------
  1.	If ./autogen does not work, you probably don't have
  	libtool installed. Or autoconf, automake. These are
  	standard package in a linux system.
  2.	If ./configure doesn't find some header or library,
	install what is requested and make sure it can be found
	by the compiler. The libraries libusb-1.0.so may require
	a symbolic link to libusb.so. This may also be true for
	libftd2xx. Make sure you follow the instructions of the
	libftd2xx library! Libusb comes as a package in all linux
	distributions. There are two versions: 0.1 and 1.0. Install
	version 1.0.
  3.	If make fails, you should talk to a code maintainer.
  4.	If psi46expert won't start because a library is missing,
  	set your custom library path with
  	
  		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:YOURPATH
  
  5.	If psi46expert cannot open a port to the testboard, then
  	make sure the testboard name is correct in the configParameters.dat
  	file in you config directory. If this is the case, make
  	sure that you have write access to your usb devices:
  	
  		ls -l /dev/bus/usb/00?/*
  	
  	You can change these permissions permanently if you create a file
  	/etc/udev/rules.d/10-testboard.rules which contains
  	
  		SUBSYSTEM == "usb", ATTR{product} == "DLP-USB245M", GROUP="usb", MODE="0664"
  	
  	and create a group "usb" and add yourself to that group. Newly
  	plugged devices will have the correct permissions. If it still
  	does not work, check whether you have the kernel modules
  	ftdi_sio and usbserial loaded. These MUST NOT be loaded, you
  	can blacklist them by googling 'modprobe blacklist' and
  	following any instructions.
  6.	If all things fail, you should talk to a code maintainer.
